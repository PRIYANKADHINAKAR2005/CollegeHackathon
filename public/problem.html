                    Description: <br>        In many organizations, documents are often stored in non-machine-readable formats, making it difficult to search, analyze, and extract useful information efficiently. This problem becomes even more challenging when dealing with large volumes of documents in varying formats. The goal of TransformoDocs is to address these challenges by restricting the ingestion of non-machine-readable documents and enabling their seamless conversion to machine-readable formats. The system aims to automate the conversion process using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, ensuring that documents are structured and searchable. Additionally, it integrates AI-based search functionality, enabling semantic searches for better document discoverability. The system also ensures compliance with accessibility standards like WCAG and provides reporting and analytics features for insights into document usage patterns. This solution will improve document accessibility, searchability, and overall efficiency in managing large volumes of documents.

                    Description: <br>     With the increasing demand for immersive and engaging gaming experiences, there is a need to develop interactive games that allow players to actively participate in and influence the game world. Traditional games often limit player interaction to predefined actions, which can lead to repetitive gameplay. The goal is to create games that provide a dynamic environment where players can make meaningful choices, explore new possibilities, and experience unique outcomes based on their interactions. This will require integrating advanced technologies, such as AI, to enhance non-player character (NPC) behavior, as well as developing systems for player-driven storytelling, realistic physics, and real-time feedback. The result will be a more personalized, engaging, and immersive gaming experience, fostering deeper player involvement and long-term retention.
